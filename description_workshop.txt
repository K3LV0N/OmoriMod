[h1]Omori Mod[/h1]

Make your enemies sad, happy, or angry to exploit an [b]emotional advantage![/b]

All items in this mod build off of eachother, and if they don't then you can learn about them from the Note!
Additionally, most items are made using the emotion changers sold by the merchant.

If you have't played Omori then you totaly should! It is an awesome game and I cannot
reccomend it more!!! (You can find it [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150690/OMORI/]here![/url])

[b]Content[/b]
Completely changed emotion system.
[list]
	[*]Emotions now display stat changes when hovering over the buff.
	[*]Emotions can go up to tier 4+ (where tier 4 has levels 1-40) for increased potency.
	[*]Added new item 'Emotional Amplifier' available for purchase from the merchant in hardmode that allows you to get tier 4+ emotions
[/list]

To get to a tier 4 emotion, you must first have an active tier 3 emotion. Then use an emotional amplifier.
When used, the corresponding tier 4 will be applied at level 1. If further emotional amplifiers are used,
the level of the tier 4 emotion will increase up to a maximum of 40!

I made some really big overhauls this update so there are bound to be bugs I did not catch.
