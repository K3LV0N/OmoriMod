Omori Mod

Make your enemies sad, happy, or angry to exploit an emotional advantage!

All items in this mod build off of eachother, and if they don't then you can learn about them from the Note!
Additionally, most items are made using the emotion changers sold by the merchant.

If you have't played Omori then you totaly should! It is an awesome game and I cannot
reccomend it more!!! (You can find it on steam!)


Features: 
- Brand new emotion system featuring 3 new tiered buffs!
- New weapons and items that inflict emotions on enemies!
- New enemies and bosses from Omori!

ChangeLog:

UPDATE 1.20.0.0: Holy Moly!

CONTENT:

- Completely reworked Ye Old Sprout boss
-- Boss runs smoother and is more polished than before
-- Changed the sprites of "Treasure Bag (Ye Old Sprout)", "Sprout Mole", and "Mini Mole"
-- Changed how Sprouts were animated: used to face target -> now face direction they are moving

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Ye Old Sprout jump animation.
- Fixed many small bugs involving Sprout velocity
- Fixed bug with projectiles that prevented them from piercing enemies properly.
-- Sprout Scythe has been "buffed" because of this

Tweaks:
- Nerfed Sprout Shotgun
- Nerfed Sprout movement speed

Optimizations:
- Optimized Chargebar so that it is hopefully less computationally expensive to render

Structure:
- Added brand new NPC state management tool. Mod size might increase because of this, but development is easier.

Other Notices:
- Have fun!
- Please let me know if you find any bugs or have any comments in the discord!






HOTFIX 1.19.1.2

- Fixed a major bug that completely obliterated enemy defense when angry was applied
- Fixed a major bug that makes enemies near unkillable when sad was applied.



HOTFIX 1.19.1.1

- Fixed a bug where Emotional Amplifiers were not buyable



UPDATE 1.19.1: Now with feelings!

CONTENT:

- Completely changed emotion system.
-- Emotions now display stat changes when hovering over the buff.
-- Emotions can go up to tier 4+ (where tier 4 has levels 1-40) for increased potency.
-- Added new item 'Emotional Amplifier' available for purchase from the merchant in hardmode that allows you to get tier 4+ emotions


To get to a tier 4 emotion, you must first have an active tier 3 emotion. Then use an emotional amplifier.
When used, the corresponding tier 4 will be applied at level 1. If further emotional amplifiers are used,
the level of the tier 4 emotion will increase up to a maximum of 40!

More content coming sometime!!


BUG FIXES:

- Hopefully fixed bug where Sprout Shotgun could shoot through walls at close range.


STRUCTURE:

- Gutted old emotion system and replaced it with a brand new modular system that performs advantage checks without needing to know emotion
- 'Optimized' FocusWeapons for multiplayer
- 'Optimized' Items and their load times


PLANS:

- Rework Ye Old Sprout AI so that the fight looks / feels good (Current top priority)
- Town NPCs
- Completely rework melee weapons with new system revolving around new town NPC.
- Summons at some point :(


OTHER NOTICES:

I made some really big overhauls this update so there are bound to be bugs I did not catch.
If you notice any, please join the discord and let me know in the #bugs channel!

Also, I really worked my butt off for this update, so I hope people enjoy! (even though there isn't much new content)
