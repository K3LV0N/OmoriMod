Omori Mod is a mod that adds emotions into the game!

Make your enemies sad, happy, or angry to exploit an emotional advantage!

All items in this mod build off of eachother, and if they don't then you can learn about them from the Note!
Additionally, most items are made using the emotion changers sold by the merchant.

If you have't played Omori then you totaly should! It is an awesome game and I cannot
reccomend it more!!! (You can find it on steam!)

UPDATE 1.19.0.0:

The sprout moles unite!

-Added the first boss

-****Hopefully balanced melee weapons

-Fixed sad, depressed, and miserable data types

-NERFED Sprout moles, they were originally too strong (didn't take much knockback)
--Sprout moles move more organically now

-Updated Sprites

As usual please join the discord and let me know in the bugs channel of any bugs you find!


UPDATE 1.18.0.0:

-Added new damage type 'focus' which currently is a blend of ranged and magic right now (this damage type
	gets the beefits from each so do as you please for now). This will entually change in the future to be
	its own full type with armor, accessories and other things to benefit. I also additionally plan to add
	calamity support (AKA a leveling system) so this class does not get left behind over time.

-Added First 'focus' class weapon. When holding this weapon out it charges. When charged, the weapon does more damage
	and starts to decay. To recharge, simply stop firing and the charge bar will start filling up again. The weapon
	can currently be made with a book and rainclouds, HOWEVER, this recipe WILL change in the future (when I add more
	ingredients, ores, etc.).

-Made it so note starts in the players inventory upon character creation (still can be made with 1 dirt)

-Updated bat sprites (courtesy of @ran24 on discord for supplying the sprites. Join the server!!!)

-Probably did some other stuff like code clean up but I forget lol

-NOTE: more 'focus' class weapons will come out!



OLDER UPDATES (If you want to read the patch notes):



UPDATE 1.17:

Brought the mod to tmod 1.4.4!

-Found and fixed a bug where upgraded arrows could and would drop their stage 1 counterparts or even other emotional arrows entirely

-Reduced mod size and overall bloat by (approximately) 10-20% (I think)

-Cleaned up code architecture significantly which should make bug fixes faster and easier

-KNOWN BUG: Sad, Depressed, and Miserable statuses make you lose a set amount of mana as opposed to a percentage.
 I do not know how to fix this right now, I am actively thinking of a solution to this.
 
I changed a LOT from almost every single file in this update (tbh, the biggest update yet really), so PLEASE join the discord
to inform me of any bugs you may find!


UPDATE 1.16.14:

Fixed a long standing bug where upgraded 'rain' (sad) ammo did not move faster than its other emotional counterparts


UPDATE 1.16.13:

Revamped how emotion is shown.


UPDATE 1.16.12:

Added speed changes on enemies! Turns out it's possible when
you think about how speed and velocity effect a NPC's
position!


UPDATE 1.16.11:

Removed speed changes on enemeies when they have emotions

I found out that it is near impossible to simply change the speed
of a NPC so they are going to remain untouched for now. However,
I plan to keep messing with this to see if I can get it to work. 
As of now though, I would have to change each enemy's AI individually
which is absolutely insane, hence I will not be doing it.

However, this can be easily implemented with modded enemies, so I
may consider doing such in the future.


UPDATE 1.16.10:

Fixed and reworked emotions so they properly work now
-Sad, Depressed, and Miserable were nerfed
--These properly make you slow now

-Happy, Ecstatic, and Manic were buffed
--Reworked speed buff
--Lowered chance to miss

-Angry, Enraged, and Furious were changed
--Deal higher damage than before
--Take more damage than before
