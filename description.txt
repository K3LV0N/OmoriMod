Omori Mod is a mod that adds emotions into the game!

Make your enemies sad, happy, or angry to exploit an emotional advantage!

All items in this mod build off of eachother, and if they don't then you can learn about them from the Note!
Additionally, most items are made using the emotion changers sold by the merchant.

If you have't played Omori then you totaly should! It is an awesome game and I cannot
reccomend it more!!! (You can find it on steam!)

UPDATE 1.19.1: Now with feelings!

CONTENT:

- Completely changed emotion system.
-- Emotions now display stat changes when hovering over the buff.
-- Emotions can go up to tier 4+ (where tier 4 has levels 1-40) for increased potency.
-- Added new item 'Emotional Amplifier' available for purchase from the merchant in hardmode that allows you to get tier 4+ emotions


To get to a tier 4 emotion, you must first have an active tier 3 emotion. Then use an emotional amplifier.
When used, the corresponding tier 4 will be applied at level 1. If further emotional amplifiers are used,
the level of the tier 4 emotion will increase up to a maximum of 40!

More content coming sometime!!


BUG FIXES:

- Hopefully fixed bug where Sprout Shotgun could shoot through walls at close range.


STRUCTURE:

- Gutted old emotion system and replaced it with a brand new modular system that performs advantage checks without needing to know emotion
- 'Optimized' FocusWeapons for multiplayer
- 'Optimized' Items and their load times


PLANS:

- Rework Ye Old Sprout AI so that the fight looks / feels good (Current top priority)
- Town NPCs
- Completely rework melee weapons with new system revolving around new town NPC.
- Summons at some point :(


OTHER NOTICES:

I made some really big overhauls this update so there are bound to be bugs I did not catch.
If you notice any, please join the discord and let me know in the #bugs channel!

Also, I really worked my butt off for this update, so I hope people enjoy! (even though there isn't much new content)






OLDER UPDATES:


UPDATE 1.19.0.3:

- Massive architectural changes to prepare for summoner class expansion and additional pets
-- Currently there is only 1 summoner weapon, and I want to make the class have weapons like every other class has at this point
-- Expansion will include a weapon for each emotion for each stage of the game, and a summon weapon dropped from the boss.

Content coming soon!!! (I hope!!!)


UPDATE 1.19.0.2:

-Various bug fixes:
-- Fixed bug with large damage for party arrow+ and it's bullet counterpart
-- Fixed issue with projectiles not spawning for melee weapons when against a wall
-- Fixed issue with sprout shotgun sprite being massive

- Nerfed Chlorophyte weapons homing range quite a bit (800 -> 300)

- Added small architecture changes for later expansion



Known Bugs and Issues:

- Sprout shotgun sprite floats off the ground

- Sprout moles cannot walk over hammered blocks

- Emotions are unbalanced, need to find a way to fix this

- Identifyable and fixable bloat (definite mod size reduction and improved workflow)




UPDATE 1.19.0.1:

-More massive architecture changes (removed ~40% of mod bloat)

-Changed the way the charge bar looks

-Updated mod to .NET 8




UPDATE 1.19.0.0:

The sprout moles unite!

-Added the first boss

-****Hopefully balanced melee weapons

-Fixed sad, depressed, and miserable data types

-NERFED Sprout moles, they were originally too strong (didn't take much knockback)
--Sprout moles move more organically now

-Updated Sprites

As usual please join the discord and let me know in the bugs channel of any bugs you find!



UPDATE 1.18.0.0:

-Added new damage type 'focus' which currently is a blend of ranged and magic right now (this damage type
	gets the beefits from each so do as you please for now). This will entually change in the future to be
	its own full type with armor, accessories and other things to benefit. I also additionally plan to add
	calamity support (AKA a leveling system) so this class does not get left behind over time.

-Added First 'focus' class weapon. When holding this weapon out it charges. When charged, the weapon does more damage
	and starts to decay. To recharge, simply stop firing and the charge bar will start filling up again. The weapon
	can currently be made with a book and rainclouds, HOWEVER, this recipe WILL change in the future (when I add more
	ingredients, ores, etc.).

-Made it so note starts in the players inventory upon character creation (still can be made with 1 dirt)

-Updated bat sprites (courtesy of @ran24 on discord for supplying the sprites. Join the server!!!)

-Probably did some other stuff like code clean up but I forget lol

-NOTE: more 'focus' class weapons will come out!



OLDER UPDATES (If you want to read the patch notes):



UPDATE 1.17:

Brought the mod to tmod 1.4.4!

-Found and fixed a bug where upgraded arrows could and would drop their stage 1 counterparts or even other emotional arrows entirely

-Reduced mod size and overall bloat by (approximately) 10-20% (I think)

-Cleaned up code architecture significantly which should make bug fixes faster and easier

-KNOWN BUG: Sad, Depressed, and Miserable statuses make you lose a set amount of mana as opposed to a percentage.
 I do not know how to fix this right now, I am actively thinking of a solution to this.
 
I changed a LOT from almost every single file in this update (tbh, the biggest update yet really), so PLEASE join the discord
to inform me of any bugs you may find!


UPDATE 1.16.14:

Fixed a long standing bug where upgraded 'rain' (sad) ammo did not move faster than its other emotional counterparts


UPDATE 1.16.13:

Revamped how emotion is shown.


UPDATE 1.16.12:

Added speed changes on enemies! Turns out it's possible when
you think about how speed and velocity effect a NPC's
position!


UPDATE 1.16.11:

Removed speed changes on enemeies when they have emotions

I found out that it is near impossible to simply change the speed
of a NPC so they are going to remain untouched for now. However,
I plan to keep messing with this to see if I can get it to work. 
As of now though, I would have to change each enemy's AI individually
which is absolutely insane, hence I will not be doing it.

However, this can be easily implemented with modded enemies, so I
may consider doing such in the future.


UPDATE 1.16.10:

Fixed and reworked emotions so they properly work now
-Sad, Depressed, and Miserable were nerfed
--These properly make you slow now

-Happy, Ecstatic, and Manic were buffed
--Reworked speed buff
--Lowered chance to miss

-Angry, Enraged, and Furious were changed
--Deal higher damage than before
--Take more damage than before
